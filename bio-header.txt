My name is Brittni, I am a front-end and object oriented programmer.



I am a graduate from Eastern Washington University with a Bachelor of Science
in Computer Science. Currently I am enrolled in a web development bootcamp at
Thinkful. My favorite aspect of coding is, when simplified, one large
puzzle. Nothing feels more satisfying than solving each "puzzle" in the most
efficient and orderly way I can.

Besides programming, I enjoy several hobbies that involve creating art. I 
spend my time drawing digital art, animating 2d animation, and beadwork.
